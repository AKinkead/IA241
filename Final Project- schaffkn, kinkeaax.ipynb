First, we learned that in order to display our job posts by date, they needed to be in chronological order. We were unable to perform this action in Jupyter Notebook so we had to return to our Excel file to sort them. Second, when analyzing common job skills, \"must\" appeared as our second most common skill. Must is a word that we would have expected to be removed by the stop words but it was not. "
